## Contributing to a project

We at Devies Development appreciate all forms of contributions, no matter how small! Feel free to open a pull request to solve an issue or ask for help.

Issues in Github are used for our project to track ideas, work, and bugs.

### Creating Issues

Structure suggestion:

- Context: explain the conditions which led you to write this issue.

- Problem or idea: the context should lead to something, an idea, or a problem that youâ€™re facing.

- Solution or next step: this is where you move forward. You can engage others (request feedback), assign somebody else to the issue, or simply leave it for further investigation, but you need to propose a next step towards solving the issue.
